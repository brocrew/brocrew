# 294 · the mutation harness — and it lives HERE, in the repo, on purpose.
#
# The harness 146 built and every dispatch since has re-pointed. It lives in the repo for the reason
# 145 LOW 2 gave: a mutation table nobody can replay is a claim (113). Anyone at this commit can run
# `scripts/mutations/294/mutate.sh` and get `mutations.txt` back. ⚠️ **The path matters**: every
# table's harness `tee`s over its OWN `mutations.txt`, so running a previous dispatch's script here
# would destroy that dispatch's committed evidence and tell you nothing about this one.
#
# Each mutation is THE DEFECT, reverted verbatim (131) — see `mutations.py`, which is also the thing
# that refuses to proceed when a target string is not found exactly once, which refuses a replacement
# equal to its anchor (252's phantom survivor), and which carries the `--dry-run` that reads the tree
# without touching it (166 §11).
#
# ⛔ **294 wrote this table and did NOT run it.** Its dispatch §4 says so: *"Write, do not run."* So
# `mutations.txt` does not exist at 294's HEAD and its absence is the honest state — `238`'s lesson
# is that a row can sit green beside prose insisting it must die, and only a run closes that. All ten
# anchors were verified present exactly once (`mutations.py --dry-run .`), which is the whole of what
# can be checked without running.
#
# ## What each project is doing here
#
# `M1`-`M3` mutate `app-lifetime.ts` and `M10` mutates `index.ts`; both die in `desktop`, the first
# three against `app-lifetime.test.ts`'s ordered log and the last against its source census over the
# composition root. `M4`-`M9` mutate `last-resort-exit.ts` and die in `desktop` against
# `last-resort-exit.test.ts` — which spawns REAL processes, kills a real one, and watches a real
# parent-pid guard refuse, because a fake clock is exactly the instrument that certified 271's bound
# for three dispatches while it had never once fired.
#
# ⚠️ Whenever reached, `runtime`, `dom` and `scripts` run WHOLE and are expected GREEN: 294 touches
# no runtime package file and no renderer file. A proved out-of-reach cell says
# `NOT RUN (out of reach)`; an unknown or unproved topology runs it. 294 changes
# `app-closes-check.mjs`, which launches a real Electron and is therefore not in that project, and
# the rows that would have covered it are named as deliberate omissions in `mutations.py`.
#
# ⚠️ Like 240, 243, 247, 248, 250, 253, 257, 261, 265 and 292, this table does NOT mutate the harness
# it is run by.
#
# ⛔ **Three rows in OTHER tables were corrected in place by 294 and are not re-covered here** —
# `271 M6`, `271 M12`, `271 M14` and `254 M25`. `271`'s §3 mechanism was replaced outright, so M12
# now removes the call that arms the closer and M14 is re-aimed at the sentence the closer prints;
# `mutations.py` in each table says so on the row and in its docstring. Corrected in place, never
# retired (142) — a retired row protects nothing, and those defects are still live.
#
# Usage:  scripts/mutations/294/mutate.sh [index ...]      (no args = M0 control + every mutation)
