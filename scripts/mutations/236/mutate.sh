# 236 · the mutation harness — and it lives HERE, in the repo, on purpose.
#
# The harness 146 built and every dispatch since has re-pointed. It lives in the repo for the reason
# 145 LOW 2 gave: a mutation table nobody can replay is a claim (113). Anyone at this commit can run
# `scripts/mutations/236/mutate.sh` and get `mutations.txt` back.
#
# Each mutation is THE DEFECT, reverted verbatim (131) — see `mutations.py`, which is also the thing
# that refuses to proceed when a target string is not found exactly once, and which carries the
# `--dry-run` that reads the tree without touching it (166 §11).
#
# ## What each project is doing here
#
# `desktop` holds §1's host comparison, §3's policy and gate, and the two books §4/§5 changed;
# `dom` holds the composer and the pane, which is where the drop race and Attention's Open are
# OBSERVABLE rather than merely written. Both are load-bearing in this table, and several rows die
# in one and not the other. Every project the conservative derivation reaches still runs whole.
#
# ⚠️ `runtime` and `scripts` are not universal GREEN columns. Each runs WHOLE where the frozen
# derivation can reach it; every proved out-of-reach cell says `NOT RUN (out of reach)`, never GREEN,
# while an unknown or unproved path runs every project.
#
# Usage:  scripts/mutations/236/mutate.sh [index ...]      (no args = M0 control + every mutation)
