# 232 · the mutation harness — and it lives HERE, in the repo, on purpose.
#
# The harness 146 built and every dispatch since has re-pointed. It lives in the repo for the reason
# 145 LOW 2 gave: a mutation table nobody can replay is a claim (113). Anyone at this commit can run
# `scripts/mutations/232/mutate.sh` and get `mutations.txt` back.
#
# Each mutation is THE DEFECT, reverted verbatim (131) — see `mutations.py`, which is also the thing
# that refuses to proceed when a target string is not found exactly once, and which carries the
# `--dry-run` that reads the tree without touching it (166 §11).
#
# ⚠️ **The dry-run's arguments are `--dry-run <root>`, in that order.** `harness.sh`'s lock message
# prints `python3 <table>/mutations.py . --dry-run`, which raises `ValueError`. ⛔ **This is the
# EIGHTH dispatch to record that rather than fix it** (209, 211, 212, 214, 217, 218, 219, now this):
# it is blocked on 206 H2's gate and it is one line plus one argument order. ⚑ **And the trap beside
# it**: the handler is `restore; rm -rf "$WORK"; release_tree_lock` on `EXIT PIPE INT TERM HUP`, so
# an interrupted run fires it TWICE and always ends with a screenful of `cp: No such file or
# directory` that means nothing — which is how somebody learns to ignore a real `RESTORE FAILED`.
# `trap - EXIT` at the top of the handler fixes it. Measured in 214, when a killed run printed it.
#
# ## Four ways this harness lied before it worked, all still guarded
#
# The pristine copy was keyed by BASENAME, and this repo has two `session-store.ts`. Keyed by full
# relative path, and `verify_restore` compares bytes after every restore.
#
# "Non-zero test count" was not enough. A corrupted tree made three suites fail to COLLECT while
# vitest went on reporting a stable, non-zero, wrong number. Every run is compared against the M0
# baseline and a short run is reported as INVALID rather than as a verdict.
#
# Two dry-runs have corrupted the tree. 157/166 used `git checkout --` and lost uncommitted work;
# 166's "safe" replacement used a bash-style `for f in $FILES` loop in a shell that is ZSH. Do not
# apply `mutations.py` by hand. This file is `bash`, run as a FILE, which is what makes the loops
# below behave.
#
# And 180 added a fourth: do not EDIT a mutated file while this is running. The restore is a byte
# copy from the pristine tree, so an edit made mid-run is silently reverted with the mutation. Stop
# it, re-check the anchors with `--dry-run`, and re-run the whole table.
#
# Knowing when it is DONE: wait on the LOCK, never on what this prints (197).
# `until [ ! -d scripts/mutations/.tree-lock ]`.
#
# ## ⛔ FOUR projects, over the paths `mutations.py --files` returns
#
# 232 is THE PATH YOU CHOSE IS A PROMISE. A staged chip is a record of what a person consented to,
# and `227` found it treated as a string twice: re-derived at send time and taken on trust, and
# interpolated into the model's input unescaped.
#
#   * `main/runtime/{handed-path,ipc,runtime-host}.ts`, `shared/runtime-ipc.ts` and
#     `renderer/src/lib/send-refusals.ts` → **`desktop`**. What a chosen path IS, whether it is still
#     that thing at the press, and what reaches the provider — asserted by `no-byte-authority`,
#     `handed-path-send`, `one-way-to-stage`, `send-refusals` and `host-renderer-agreement`.
#   * `scripts/ui-live-smoke.mjs` → **`scripts`**, and only as SOURCE: `step-census.test.mjs` requires
#     the census to name exactly the steps the smoke offers, so a live step that vanishes is caught.
#
# ⛔ **What that costs is named rather than hidden.** No row here proves the app refuses a real press
# over a real filesystem: every one is killed by a unit test. That gesture is `BROBOT_SMOKE_ONLY=11h`
# and only that.
#
# NO row mutates `runtime`, and no renderer component changed in this dispatch. Under the frozen
# derivation, `runtime` and `dom` run WHOLE only on rows that can reach them; the other cells say
# `NOT RUN (out of reach)`, never GREEN. An unknown or unproved path runs every project.
#
# Usage:  scripts/mutations/232/mutate.sh [index ...]      (no args = M0 control + every mutation)
